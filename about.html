            My favorite part of studying computer science is that there's always more to learn. 
            It is as much about creativity as it is about logic and reasoning. 
            As someone who loves art and literature as much as concrete logic, it's the best of both worlds. 
            <br><br>
            Since beginning my computer science studies, I've delved into both frontend and backend languages and frameworks. 
            In my college courses, I've learned <b>programming in C++, Java, and Python</b> by writing programs that implement <b>object oriented programming and data structures </b>.
            I've also learned about web design using <b>HTML, CSS, native Javascript, PHP, and MySQL</b> to create both static and interactive websites. 
            <br><br>
            Independently, I've begun learning React.JS, Swift, and how to work with mongoDB, NodeJS and ExpressJS.
            I'm currently in the process of building a web app that tracks personal finances. 
            <br><br>
            My current objective is to get an internship where I can apply and advance my skills, expand my knowledge of programming, and gain valuable hands-on experience. 
            I'm especially interested in enhancing usability, solving real world problems, and making technology accessible for all.
