                    Growing up, I never had a favorite subject in school, because I loved every subject. I loved art and literature but also math and science. I loved exploring abstract concepts as much as I loved applying clear logic. In college, I discovered that I could have the best of both worlds by studying computer science.
                    <br><br>
                    Since beginning my computer science studies, I've delved into both frontend and backend languages and frameworks. I'm familiar with Python and Java programming, as well as HTML, CSS, Javascript for web design. I also have some experience with PHP and MySQL. 
                    I've developed a true passion for enhancing usability, coming up with solutions to real world problems, and building projects from the ground up.
                    <br><br>
                    My current objective is to get an internship where I can apply and advance my skills, expand my knowledge of programming, and gain valuable hands-on experience.
